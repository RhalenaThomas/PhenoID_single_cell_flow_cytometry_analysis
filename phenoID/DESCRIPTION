Description: A set of functions to work with flowcytometry files acquired from FlowJo and exported as 	
		FSC files. It was created to easily read in and analyze multiple samples from an
		antibody panel experiment with 12 or more antibodies. Functions are provided to read
		in the data, rename channels and files(samples), visualize the data and align
		samples.  Soon to come, functions for clustering.  Functions for cluster 
		visualization.
